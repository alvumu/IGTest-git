# General Principles

This page outlines a few general principles to ensure the Implementation Guide is generated and navigated correctly.

- Always include `sidebar_order` in the front matter to control the pageâ€™s position in the navigation.
- Verify that the file name `general-principles.md` is placed under `input/pagecontent/` so that the IG Publisher can include it.
